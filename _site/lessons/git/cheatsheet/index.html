  <h1 class="page-title">Cheatsheet: Git</h1>
  <p>Git is an amazing and very powerful tool that is useful for managing
your projects and tools, letting you experiment and try out new things
in your files without worrying about losing anything.  However,
because of its power and usefulness, it can be confusing for beginners
as 1) Git requires the use of the command line (or terminal) to run
Git commands, and 2) there are a large number of commands and options
available.  So, we put together the commands that are the most useful
and most common — and the only ones you may ever use!  Also, please check out
the <a href="/lessons/resources">resources page</a> as it has links to very useful sites
and tutorials on learning Git.</p>

<p>As well, an added benefit of using Git is you can use the amazing
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, a git repository hosting service, to keep an
online backup of your project and optionally share it with the world or with
your team.  There are increasing arguments and support for science to be more
open and publicly accessible.  GitHub can help with getting your code and/or
data out into the public domain.  Some of the below commands are used for
communicating with GitHub, though they are not exclusive to GitHub.</p>

<h1 id="before-using-git-initial-setup">Before using Git: Initial setup</h1>

<p>This following commands should be run first before any work is done
using Git.</p>

<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@some.domain"
git config --global color.ui "auto"
git config --global core.editor "your_editor"
git config --global push.default simple
git config --list
</code></pre>

<p>These commands basically tell Git:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who you are (<code>user.name</code>)</li>
  <li>What your email address is (<code>user.email</code>; used when working on a
multiple person project)</li>
  <li>What the colour output should be after running Git commands
(<code>color.ui</code>)</li>
  <li>What your <strong>text</strong> editor is that you use (<code>core.editor</code>).  See
<a href="/lessons/instructions/">our instructions</a> for more
details about editors, but briefly:
    <ul>
      <li>On Windows, you will likely use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_%28software%29">Notepad</a>
(which comes pre-installed on Windows) or
<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
      <li>On Mac, there is
<a href="http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11009/textwrangler">TextWrangler</a>
(which I believe comes pre-installed) or
<a href="https://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></li>
      <li>On Linux, it depends on which distro you use, but in general
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit">gedit</a> or
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nano">nano</a> usually are
pre-installed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How you want the push and pull default behaviour (<code>push.default</code>;
more on this in the <a href="/lessons/github/">GitHub lesson</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="terminal-commands-good-to-know-before-knowing-git">Terminal commands (good to know before knowing Git)</h1>

<h2 id="directory-terminology">Directory (terminology)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A directory is the same thing as a folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="cd-pathtodirectory"><code>cd path/to/directory</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change the current directory/folder to another directory/folder. The little
tilde <code>~</code> means ‘Home’, so that would be <code>/home/username/</code> for Linux,
<code>/Users/username/</code> for Mac, and <code>C:\Users\username\</code> on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop # Change to the desktop
cd /home/username/Documents/ # Change to documents.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="mkdir-directory-name"><code>mkdir directory-name/</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make (mk) a directory (dir) that has the name <code>directory-name</code>. This can be
any name you want it to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/Desktop/testing # Create a testing folder on your desktop
mkdir playingAround/ # Make a folder in the current directory
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ls"><code>ls</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>View the contents of the directory, showing files and sub-directories.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>ls ~/ # Show contents of home
ls -a ~/ # Show hidden and non-hidden files

# List files/directories by row, indicating which is a folder
# l = list format option
# h = human understandable bytes option
# F = indicate which are folders with a `/` at the end
ls -lhF ~/
ls -l -h -F ~/ # Same as above
</code></pre>

<h2 id="touch-filenametxt"><code>touch filename.txt</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create an empty text file in the current directory called ‘filename.txt’.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code># All these do the same thing.
touch filename.txt
touch File.txt
touch this-is-a-file.txt
</code></pre>

<h2 id="command--filenametxt"><code>command &gt; filename.txt</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Send the output into a file (in this case called ‘filename.txt’.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>ls -lhF &gt; filesInDirectory.txt # Send ls output to file
echo 'This is a test' &gt; testing.txt # Send to the file
</code></pre>

<h1 id="useful-and-common-git-commands">Useful (and common) Git commands</h1>

<h2 id="repository-terminology">Repository (terminology)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a command, but is the term used to describe all the saved history of a
directory and files for a project that are tracked by Git. Is essentially the
hidden <code>.git/</code> directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="git-init"><code>git init</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell Git to start tracking a folder by creating a git history
repository.  This essentially tells Git to start watching your
folder and all the files and folders within it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## Comment: cd = change directory (aka folder)
cd ~/Documents/yourprojectname/
git init
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-status"><code>git status</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tell Git to list out all the activity within a folder under watch by
Git (after using <code>git init</code>).  The status command will list all
files or folders that have been added or changed inside the
repository. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd ~/Documents/yourprojectname/
git status
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-add-files"><code>git add &lt;files&gt;</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add the files you want Git to watch inside the history repository as
created with <code>git init</code>.  You can specify as many or as little files
or folders as you want.  <em>Note</em>: the add command does <strong>not</strong> save
the files to the git history.  All the <code>git add</code> command does is
tell Git to start watching the files and put the files into the
“staging area” where they will next be saved to the history (see the
below <code>git commit</code> command).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## Comment: cd to where files have been changed
cd ~/Documents/yourprojectname/
## Comment: Pretending we want to add three files
git add foldername/newfilename1 newfilename2 foldername2/changedfile
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-commit"><code>git commit</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tells Git to save your <code>git add</code>‘ed files to its history.  This is
the main purpose and use for Git.  After you commit a file(s) and
typed out a commit message (<em>be detailed about what you did</em>!!), Git
will save (or take a “snap shot”) of your files and put it into its
history.  Once committed, it is saved into the history, allowing you
to go back to that commit/save point at any time!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd ~/Documents/yourprojectname/
## Comment: You have two options...
## Commit and let a text editor pop up so you can
## write your commit message
git commit
## Comment: ... Or you can use the -m option
git commit -m "Type out your commit message here"
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-log"><code>git log</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Displays the history of your repository and the messages you added
to each commit, as well as the date of the change, and who made the
change.  This is analogous to a logbook for those in the basic
science.  This is a really useful feature if you are working on a
multi-person project or if you are coming back to a project after
several months of not touching it and completely forgetting what you
were doing last.  <code>git log</code> has a <em>large</em> number of options
available that customize the appearance and the information provided
by the log command.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd ~/Documents/yourprojectname/
git log
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-checkout"><code>git checkout</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows you to go back (or forward) throughout your Git history as
well as to change branches (see the <code>git branch</code> command below).  If
you wanted to go back a few commits, you would run <code>git checkout
commitnumber</code>.  You get the commit number by running git log and
using the first few letters and numbers of the commit.  We will
likely show an example in the workshop.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## Comment: Go back to a previous commit (use the commit hash)
git checkout d45gfd3 ## Example commit hash, found using git log
## Comment: Go to another branch (ie: "testing")
git checkout testing
## Comment: Go back to your main branch ("master")
git checkout master
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-branch-branch-name"><code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is another very useful command from Git, and (I feel) one of
its biggest strengths!  This command basically makes a branch like
on a tree, letting you experiment with your files and statistical
analyses without having to worry about messing around with your main
files.  If you want to eventually bring the experimental branch into
the “master” branch, you can use
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging"><code>git merge</code></a>
(which we will not be covering as it is a slightly more advanced
command).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## Create a branch named "experiment"
git branch experiment
## Move to the experiment branch
git checkout experiment
## edit your files and save, do whatever...
git add changedfiles
git commit -m "Added a statistical test with different variables"
## Move back to the master branch
git checkout master
## All files should be in their original state
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-diff-commit-id-optional-files"><code>git diff &lt;commit-id (optional)&gt; &lt;file(s)&gt;</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This command tells Git to compare the contents of, at the basic
level, two files.  These two files are by default a file you most
recently changed (but not committed) with the same file’s content in
the history.  However, you can also compare a file across different
commits in the history.  <code>git diff</code> shows the differences between
the files by highlighting in red deletions and in green additions to
the file.  This is useful if you forgot what you changed in the file
and you are going to commit the file into the history, using it to
help you write a better commit messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## Compare a recently changed file with its recent
## commit history
git diff filename
## Compare a file across two commits (using commit hashes)
## Usage: git diff hash1..hash2 file (hashes are *very* unique)
git diff 54gfd..75g84 filename
</code></pre>

<h1 id="git-commands-for-dealing-with-githubother-hosting-services">Git commands for dealing with GitHub/other hosting services</h1>

<h2 id="git-clone-repository-name"><code>git clone &lt;repository-name&gt;</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cloning is basically downloading a new git repository that is
online/in GitHub.  You take an existing git repository and
duplicate/copy/clone it onto your own computer.  For example, if you
wanted the files for this workshop series, you would first fork our
<a href="https://github.com/codeasmanuscript/workshops">GitHub Code As Manuscript workshop repo</a>
so you have your own copy of it on your account and then you clone
it into your computer. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>## First fork our Code As Manuscript and then:
cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/repo
git clone https://github.com/your-name/workshops.git
## You now have the workshop files on your computer.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-remote-add-name-server-url"><code>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;server-url&gt;</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A remote, in git terminology, is a server or online location.
Remote is the opposite of local.  A remote repository is a
repository that is <em>not</em> on your computer, while a local repository
is.  Think of the remote as an external hard drive.  When you add a
remote, you use a name (by convention the name is usually “origin”,
which I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to use as well) that will tell git
that that is the remote name.  The server url can generally be found
on the GitHub or BitBucket page, usually in the top or bottom right
corner.  For instance, the server url for my own ‘test’ project
would be <code>https://github.com/lwjohnst86/test.git</code>.  to describe your
Git project that you want to store on the server such as Github.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/git/repo
## The actual URL can be found on GitHub, usually in the corner.
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
git push
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-push"><code>git push</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Push is essentially the same as uploading your local git repository
to the remote (GitHub) repository.  Pushing is more powerful than a
simple upload, as git checks the remote repository, compares it to
the local repository, making sure that the integrity of the files is
preserved and that nothing is lost or overwritten (unlike Dropbox
for example).  This is especially important for your research files!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/git/repo
## ... edit a file ...
git commit -am "Edited a file"
git push
</code></pre>

<h2 id="git-pull"><code>git pull</code></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is essentially a command to download the remote (GitHub)
repository contents and merge it into your own local git repository.
This is only ever used if you a) work on a project that is only more
than one computer and you use git and GitHub to sync the files
across computers, or b) if you work on a team and one or more other
person(s) are making changes to the remote (GitHub) repository.
Pulling then syncs the updated remote content with your local
content.  This is where git really shines when you collaborate with
others on a project (ie: this workshop series)!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/your/git/repo
## Someone has added stuff to the remote repo
git pull
</code></pre>
