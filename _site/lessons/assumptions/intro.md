# Outline of workshop #

* Purpose: Familiarize students with some assumptions of linear regression & teach how they can check them using SAS.
* Specifically we cover these 3 assumptions: model fit, residual distribution and residual variance. 
* Provide SAS codes that are used to examine data to see if assumptions are satisfied.
* Do not go into depth on 2 other assumptions (independence & error), but we explain what these mean and direct students to other resources about these assumptions.
* Also cover collinearity and influence/outliers. These are not assumptions, but important factors to examine in statistical models.  
* Workshop exercises (live-coding): 1) Workshop instructor and attendees run SAS codes that are provided in the workshop slides on two SAS practice datasets. Discuss the results as a group. 2) Students modify and run the SAS codes on their own data to examine the assumptions. Discuss their results with the instructor and other attendees.
