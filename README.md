Code As Manuscript Workshops
============================

This series of *hands-on* workshops aims to introduce students to the
concept of research reproducibility and to get the students practicing
with using version control systems and with using modern techniques in
R (or SAS) that make analyses less error prone and reproducible, and
that make you more efficient, productive, and in control.  Techniques
for using version control systems to faciliate greater collaboration
among peers are also taught.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to
show how to reduce the number of steps needed to go from the initial
data analysis to the final written manuscript or thesis (hence the
name *Code As Manuscript*).

The `workshops` repository is where the material is developed and
sent to the website (which is on the `gh-pages` branch).
