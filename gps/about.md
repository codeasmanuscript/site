GPS, or
[Graduate Professional Skills program](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Professional-Development.aspx),
is offered by the
[School of Graduate Studies](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/Pages/default.aspx)
at the University of Toronto.  The goal of the program is to provide
workshops that teach students skills that may be useful in careers
after they graduate.  Completing the GPS program is recorded on the
students' transcript.  Our GPS-approved *Code As Manuscript* series of
workshops provide credits to completion of the GPS program.  Our links
for the workshop series are:

* [Syllabus](sas-syllabus/) for our SAS workshops.
* [Syllabus](r-syllabus/) for our R workshops.
