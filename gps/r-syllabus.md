## Course description: ##

This series of *hands-on* workshops aims to introduce students to the
concept of research reproducibility and to get the students practicing
with using version control systems and with using modern techniques in
R that make analyses less error prone and reproducible, and that make
you more efficient, productive, and in control.  Techniques for using
version control systems to faciliate greater collaboration among peers
will also be presented.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to show
how to reduce the number of steps needed to go from the initial data
analysis to the final written manuscript or thesis (hence the name
*Code As Manuscript*).  Given the applied nature of the concepts in
these workshops, hands-on activities and
[live coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) will be
integrated into each workshop.

## Goal: ##

The expected goal of the workshops is that you will be able to:

* Put your research under version control using Git.
* Push and pull your git research repository to either
  [GitHub](https://github.com/) or
  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
* Learn the basics of R and functions within R
* Produce publication quality plots
* Quickly wrangle your data into an analyzable format
* Reproducibly incorporate R code into your manuscript or thesis to
  instantly add results and plots (no more copy and paste)

Attaining these goals will be the first steps in making an efficient
and highly productive workflow, that is also scientifically rigorous
and transparent, and which you can take with you for the rest of your
career (since R is free!).

## Schedule ##

Lesson content can be found [here](/lessons/).  The workshop will
follow the following sequence of topics on **Mondays from 3:00-6:00pm** at **65
St. George St., room 201**:

1. Git & GitHub -- Oct. 26th
2. Basics of R -- Nov. 2nd
3. Data wrangling -- Nov. 9th
4. Visualization -- Nov. 16th
5. Dynamic report generation -- Nov. 23rd

## Intended audience: ##

Graduate students or post-docs whose research involves a fair amount
of data analysis.  No experience necessary for these workshops.

## Pre-requisites: ##

* Fully charged laptop (though we do have outlets)
* Install the appropriate software (see our
  [instructions page, under the R section](/lessons/instructions/))
* Bring a positive, not-afraid-of-making-mistakes-or-feeling-unsure
  attitude!!  Learning any language (either human or computer) is
  hard work and *not* easy, but can be done!

## Assignments: ##

Because this is a hands-on workshop, at the end of each workshop, we
have an activity for you to try out.  And since this is a GPS-approved
course, if you want to get a GPS credit, you will need to:

1. Come to all the workshops (though we are flexible)
2. Complete each workshop assignment and push to the shared repository
   on GitHub (so we can track and view it).

Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet.  We will go over all these
details over the workshop series.
