  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
> - Learn the basics of R and functions within R
> - Produce publication quality plots
> - Quickly wrangle your data into an analyzable format
> - Reproducibly incorporate R code into your manuscript or thesis to
  instantly add results and plots (no more copy and paste)
