# Welcome to our Data-related workshop #

## Purpose: ##

To teach a few tips and tricks for more efficiently managing your
data, tracking your computer files, understanding appropriate
analytical approaches, and speeding up the process from code to
tables.

. . .

## Significance: ##

Topics we cover will help you get more comfortable with data, reduce
the chance of overlooked errors, and give you more control over your
work. They are also all important parts of a science movement gaining
increasing attention -- Reproducible Research.
