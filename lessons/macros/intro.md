**In development**

* Introductions
* State goal for workshop
* Item 2

* Introduction
    * Make sure they have git and github
    * Clean code, code as manuscript, sanity
    * What are macros
    * How they are useful
    * Steps-by-step to creating them
        * General rules of thumb for making them
    * Loops
    * Best practices

* Examples:
    * Bad code, good code
        * Daiva make bad code for means
        * Luke make bad code for glm (anova)
        * Both fix it (pre-WS)
    * Example of my macro library
    * Work through proc corr, proc glm, proc means
    * Create their own of a test they use often
    * Use their own data/analysis
    * Or just make up their own

* For future: mention power of combining with ODS

## Learning objectives ##

Our expectations are that after this workshop you

1. Can explain fairly well what macros and macro variables are (how
   they work, what the basic structure is, and how they are used).
