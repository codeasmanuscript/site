Depending on your circumstances, there are two possibilities for practice:

## Working solo ##

* Make a repetitive code without using a macro. You can work with one of the SAS practice datasets if you don't have your own data. Track this file using Git.
* Improve this code by making a macro. You can include both codes in the same .sas file. If you want you can even delete the long-style of code and do a "git diff" to see the changes to the file.
* Give us some "Thoughts" about this workshop as a separate text file. Feel free to include points on how you think you can apply macros in your research.
* Push both your SAS file and Thoughts file to the appropriate location in the Sandbox repo on GitHub. 


## Working in pairs ##

Pair up with a peer and:

* Each of you create your own file of a repetitive statistical code without using macros. Use the SAS practice datasets if you need to and track these files using Git.
* Push both of your files to your personal Github repo.
* Pull your partner's code file.
* Apply macros to your partner's code to improve it.
* Push to your personal Github repo and create a PR to merge to your partner's repo.
