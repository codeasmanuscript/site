Before coming to any of our workshops, please make sure to do the
following:

* Register (either from our email or from our through GPS)
* Install the required software (Git, SAS, or R) on your laptop
* Make sure to fully charge your laptop

# Software installation #

Please install these programs before coming to the workshops.  If you
have issues with installing the programs, please come 15 minutes early
to the workshop and we'll try to help you out.

## Git ##

Installation instructions for Git can be found the
[Git download site](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* On Windows: Download the `.exe` file from this
  [Github link](http://msysgit.github.io) and run it.

* On Mac: To use the graphical Git installer, download from this
  [SourceForge link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/)

* On Linux: Use your respective package manager (for example, if you
  use Ubuntu or Debian, run this code: `sudo apt-get install git`)

## Text editor ##

Because we will be writing plain text (for
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
Git), you'll need a text editor.  Most operating systems (Microsoft,
Mac, Linux) generally come pre-installed with a text editor.

* Windows: Notepad is installed by default, however
  [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html) is
  really good.  Another option is
  [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).

* Mac: [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) is good, check the
  website to install it.
  [Nano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano) is also (usually)
  pre-installed.

* Linux: Most distributions have pretty good pre-installed plain text
  editors.  For instance, Ubuntu and Debian have gedit.  Nano is also
  generally pre-installed.

## SAS (for our SAS workshops) ##

The installation instructions for SAS tend to be not the most
intuitive (especially for Linux users).  Mac users can not use SAS
natively and must dual-boot onto Windows.  SAS has their own
installation guide that comes with the CDs.

## R (for our R workshops) ##

To install R, go to the [R Project website](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
and choose your operating system.  Unlike SAS, R does not come with an
editor, so you will need to install an editor.  One very useful and
beginner-friendly editor is [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com).  For
more advanced users who are eager for a (substantial) challenge, you
can try [Emacs and ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/).
